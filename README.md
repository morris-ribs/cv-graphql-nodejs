# cv-graphql-nodejs
Under construction, but already with some magic happening ;)

Shortly, what I can tell you is that this is a GraphQL server, coded in NodeJs, that makes queries to retrieves data from a MongoDB instance.

Ideally to be called by a React-GraphQL client (to be developed afterwards :) )

As soon as the project is fully fnished, I update this with a nice step-by-step ;)
